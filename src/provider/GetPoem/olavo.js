    title: "Milky Way - Sonnet XIII",
    content: `Well (thou´ll say) hearing stars! Certainly\n
    Thou´ve lost your mind!" And I´ll say to thee, however\n
    That, to hear them, many times I wake\n
    And open the windows, palid in awe...\n
    \n
    And we talk all night long, while\n
    The milky way, as an open canopy,\n
    Shines. And, at the coming of the sun, missing and crying,\n
    I still look for them in the desert sky.\n
    \n
    Thou´ll now say: "Crazed friend!\n
    What do thou talk to them? What sense\n
    Has what they say, when they are with thee?"\n
    \n
    And I´ll say to thou: "Love to understand them!\n
    Because only he who loves may have ears\n
    Capable of hearing and understanding stars.\n`,
    poet: "Olavo Bilac"
